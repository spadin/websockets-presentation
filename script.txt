# WebSockets Presentation Script

### 01: Title Screen [0:15]

Today we're going to be presenting WebSockets and some ways you could use them. Feel free to ask questions at any point and I will do my best to answer them.

### 02: Before we begin [02:00]

There are a couple of interactive slides in this presentation. If you could load this page on your phone or laptop we could get through those slides a little more smoothly.

I'll give you a couple of minutes to bring that up.

### 03: 

Questions:
Has anybody here used WebSockets before?
